# CSE160Project1
TinyOS/NesC implementation of flooding and neighbor discovery for multi-hop wireless network simulation (CSE 160 Project 1).

The goal of this project is to extend the TinyOS skeleton code to support:
Flooding: Each node rebroadcasts received packets to neighbors, enabling multi-hop message delivery across the network. Packets must behave like pings and ping replies, without circulating indefinitely (using sequence numbers, source addresses, and TTL).
Neighbor Discovery: Each node discovers and maintains a list of its neighbors dynamically, even accounting for nodes leaving the network. Neighbor discovery is implemented without introducing new packet types, using existing ping, ping reply, flooding, and timers.
ðŸ”§ Features
TinyOS NesC implementation of flooding and neighbor discovery.
Debug channels (FLOODING_CHANNEL and NEIGHBOR_CHANNEL) for verifying message flow and neighbor tracking.
Simulation with TOSSIM using the command: make micaz sim
Source code includes handling for packet rebroadcasting, sequence numbers, TTL, and periodic neighbor checks.
ðŸ“š Deliverables
Source code (.nc files + Makefile).
One-page design decisions document.
Short answers to project discussion questions (event-driven programming, flooding vs TTL, packet counts, alternative multi-hop methods, and design trade-offs).
ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repo into your TinyOS workspace:
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CSE160-Project1-Flooding.git
  cd CSE160-Project1-Flooding
Build for simulation: make micaz sim
Run TOSSIM with the provided Python driver script.
